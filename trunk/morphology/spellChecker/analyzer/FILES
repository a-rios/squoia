 Short description of the project files
----------------------------------------

1. Lexica:
----------

nominal:
nroot.foma - contains the nominal roots
nroot-cmp-correct.foma - contains the roots that are allowed as second part of nominal compounds, other nominal roots as second part of a compound are possible, but then the compound tends to be written as two separate roots (with a space in between). This list may not be complete.
nroot-num.foma - contains numerals

verbal:
vroot.foma - contains the verbal roots

particles:
particle.foma - contains non-verbalizable particles
particle-verb.foma - contains verbalizable particles

pronouns:
prndem.foma - contains the demonstrative pronouns
prninterrog.foma - contains the interrogative pronouns
prnpers.foma - contains the personal pronouns

punctuation.foma - contains the punctuation marks the spell checker can handle (not exhaustive!)


2. Suffixes:
------------

as-*.foma - the so-called 'ambivalent' or independent suffixes, that can be attached to both nominal or verbal word forms
v-v-*.foma - verbal suffixes
n-n-*.foma - nominal suffixes
n-v.foma - verbalizing suffixes
v-n.foma - nominalizing suffixes
v-n.final - nominalizing suffixes, nominalization with these suffixes is 'final', the resulting word form can not be verbalized again (e.g. converbs)
hon-aff.foma - honorific/affective suffix -lla, actually one of the as-suffixes, but it may ocurr its position within the word is relatively free and not even restricted to the end of the word


3. Scripts:
-----------

analyzeCuzco.foma - scriptfile that builds a relatively strict transducer to be used for analysis only for Cuzco Quechua. Only 3-vocalic writing is recognized. Basically the same script as the spellchecker, but it produces a transducer, not an automaton, and can be used for analysis with flookup.
spellCheckCusco.foma - scriptfile to build the spell checker. This will produce an automaton, not a transducer.

4. Foma files
--------------

fmed.c - allows to use med search from the shell, without starting the foma interface
Makefile - standard foma Makefile that includes building fmed

5. Example confusion matrix
----------------------------

A simplistic example confusion matrix can be found in typo.matrix, a confusion matrix basically allows to give special costs to certain typos. For more information see the foma homepage (http://foma.sourceforge.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=start)
