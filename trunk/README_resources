 Lexica
---------
Note on the semantic dictionaries for Spanish used in this project:

The list of nouns with their corresponding semantic tags has been extracted from the Spanish Resource Grammar in september 2012.
 
Montserrat Marimon, Natalia Seghezzi and Núria Bel.
  An Open-source Lexicon for Spanish, Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural, n. 39, pp. 131-137. Septiembre, 2007. ISSN 1135-5948.

The original files are available from: 
http://www.upf.edu/pdi/iula/montserrat.marimon/spanish_resource_grammar.html

The lexicon of verb frames has been taken from AncoraLex Spanish 2.0.3:
http://clic.ub.edu/corpus/en/ancora-descarregues

Taulé, M., M.A. Martí, M. Recasens (2009).

Unfortunately, Ancora is not freely available, you have to register to download the resource. 
Every verb comes in its own xml file, in order to read them into a hash, paste them all in one file, e.g. like this:

$ cat *.xml > allVerbs.xml

and then use readInSemanticDix.pl to store it as hash to a file.

 FreeLing 3
-----------
squoia_analyzer needs the FreeLing library for Spanish to be installed, available here:
http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/

FreeLing is used for tokenization, tagging and named entity recognition and named entity classification. 
The folder FreeLingModules contains some adapted files to be used with FreeLing among others:
 - an adapted analyzer that return the tagged text in conll format
 - an adapted dictionary
 - an adapted constraint grammar to fine tune the tagger

 
 DeSR Parser
------------
A statistical dependency parser from Giuseppe Attardi (University of Pisa), available here:
https://sites.google.com/site/desrparser/

It can also be tested online:

 matxin-xfer-lex
--------------------- 
 Lexical transfer module from Matxin (branches), available from:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/matxin/
 
 molif-de
-----------
 Finite state morphology tool for German, used for generation of the German output:
 https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/cl/siclemat/sprachanalyse/molif/
 
 
 TeEd - Tree Editor
---------------------
Tool used for the annotation of the Quechua treebank, available from:
 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred/
 
In order to visualize the Quechua treebank files, install TrEd and copy the stylesheets in trunk/treebanks/quz/stylesheets_for_tred to .tred-stylesheets in your home directory.
Start TrEd, open one of the .pml files (those contain the annotations) and select one of the Quechua stylesheets.
A description of the annotation scheme can be found in trunk/treebanks/annotation_guidelines/anotacion.pdf (dependency trees).

 Annotate 3.6
---------------
Annotation tool for phrase structures, used for the German and Spanish treebanks. Available from:
http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/sfb378/negra-corpus/annotate.html

The Spanish treebank is annotated according to the AnCora guidelines (phrase structures), but with a simplified tagset.
The German treebank is annotated according to the TigerCorpus guidelines (phrase structures)

 TreeAligner
-------------
Tool used to annotate the alignments of the parallel treebanks (so far only Spanish-German). Available from:
http://kitt.cl.uzh.ch/kitt/treealigner

In order to visualize the parallel trees Spanish-German, download TreeAligner and open one of the 'alignments' files.
