# head chunk condition (no more than one rule per head!) - child chunk Condition(s) (can be several chunks) - ordering ("+": immediate; ".": at some distance preceding)
# IMPORTANT: variables in ordering rule need to be separated by a whitespace

## order in verb chunks: only relevant if more than one verb has to be generated from the chunks
## -> no auxiliaries, but infinitive complements, e.g. 'puedo/quiero hacer'
## -> in all other cases, only a form of the main verb has to be generated
my.smi=VMN0000			modalverb:my.smi=/VM[^N]/		head +modalverb

## order in sn chunks: indefinite/demonstrative pronouns: before noun
my.smi=/^N/			det:my.smi/^D/				det .head
