TODOS translation:

- estar as vm: better translate as ka-chka- instead of ka-?
- nouns with possessive suffixes, (llapa, kiki..)
- numbers and dates -> horas (months ok)
- participles vs. adjectives: e.g. adinerado
  -> add paradigm Noun to all Particple-N/V forms
  -> disambiguate in morph rules (precaution because the tagger still gets those mostly wrong)
- verbchunks -> chunkmi belongs at the end of the verbchunk (lasst verb) -> independent suffixes 
- según dice(n)
- dueño/propietario de -> yuq
- permanecer +Adj -> Adj-raya- 
- 1pl.incl vs. excl -> check for pronouns/possessive suffixes
- 'hace tiempo', atm: pacha ruran ;) -> change to ñawpaq pachapi or something like that
( done- use finite verb forms if even if verb chunk is has not si=top, but there's no verb chunk above (parser error) )
- if denominado + proper name: delete denominado, otherwise 'nisqa' is doubled
  denominado+Dim palcayoc ni:VRoot+Perf
- de + geographic proper name: maybe better translate as attributive than +Abl
- possessive pronouns -> possessive suffixes
- en_cuanto_a -> +Top
( done - tener hambre, sed etc: delete 'tener' from output and attach finite morphology to verb with -naya)
- keep translated indefinite article as huk? or better no article at all as default?
- default word order in verb chunk with adverb: adv obj verb, obj adj verb?
( done  - me acuerdo -> results in 1.Sg.Subj + 1.Obj -> change to +Rflx )
( done   - me acuerdo de ti -> add 1.Sg.Obj to verb )
( done:  - direct speech: if subj in direct speech = coreferent with subj of ni-  --> change to first person!)
- interjections in own chunk?
- getSentencesForGeneration -> join strings together instead of printing them out directly -> strip ',' and '++' 
  -> reordering of suffixes!
