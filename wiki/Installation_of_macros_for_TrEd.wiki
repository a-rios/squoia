In order to use the annotation mode for Quechua and/or parallel treebanks in the Tiger format (phrase structures) in TrEd, you have to install the macros in treebanks/tred_macros. 

 # install TrEd from here:
   [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred/]
 # copy the content of tred_macros in the squoia sources to the TrEd extensions directory:
{{{
$ cp -R your-squoia-repo/treebanks/tred_macro/* ~/.tred.d/extensions
}}}
 # add these lines to the file ~/.tred.d/extensions/extensions.lst

 * displays parallel trees annotated with Tiger phrase structures
 * n-n sentence alignment possible

 * two files containing the monolingual treebanks
 * one alignment file 
  ** see example in parallel_squoia/test_align.pml
  ** note: the author set in the header of the alignment file will automatically be added to every newly created or edited alignment
 * schema files of the individual treebanks
 * schema file for the alignment file 
  ** see parallel_squoia/resources/alignment_squoia_schema.xml

 * to create an alignment, drag a node and drop it above another node
 * to delete an alignment, drag one of the aligned nodes and drop it above the other node
